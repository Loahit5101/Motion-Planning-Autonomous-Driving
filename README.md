# Motion-Planning-Autonomous-Driving

The goal of this project is to develop a Motion Planning framework for Autonomous Driving in urban environments capable of generating smooth, feasible and
efficient paths to enable autonomous vehicles to navigate through obstacles and reach their desired destinations. So far, Planning in static environments has been completed.

## Setup

1. Install [CARLA](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/)

2. Libraries : Matplotlib, Numpy, networkx
